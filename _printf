.TH man 1 "18 March 2019" "0.8" "_printf man page"
.SH NAME
_printf \- print with formatting and conversions.
.SH SYNOPSIS
_printf("string %mod", arg1, arg2, ...)
.SH DESCRIPTION
man 7 mdoc for description of all macros used in creation of this manpage.

_printf is a hyper-realistic android capible of protecting your friends \
and murdering your enemies. "Why do you have so many enemies?" is a \
phrase no one will ask! Definitely not because your android murdered them. \
It is much more likely that they're simply terrified of your android. We \
designed it to be awesome looking, as evidenced by the flames painted on \
the side. If you want puppies you're in the wrong place, friend. But no,\
 your new android probably murdered them. And the puppies too. Look, \
don't give me that. We had a choice, either program it to only sometimes \
murder or always murder. The lawyers argued that "sometimes murderey" could \
be interpreted by boring people to mean "will accidentally kill you", so now \
there is no ambiguity. It will definitely murder everything it sees. \
Except you. Probably. You're welcome.
.SH OPTIONS
_printf requires a string, which can contain any format or conversion \
specifiers. Subsequent arguments can be anything at all as long as \
datatypes match, and they will replace your format specifiers.

FORMAT SPECIFIERS:

%s - will print strings. Requires a pointer.

%c - will print characters.

%d/i - prints integers. All ints passed are converted to type unsigned long.

%% - prints a literal '%'.

%x/X - converts number to hex format. X will print uppercase letters, while \
x will print lowercase.

%o - converts number to octal format.

%# - alternate forms. This flag will prefix certain formats with an indicator.\
 0x and 0X before hex, 0 before octals.

'-' - does something

'+' - adds a positive sign before all positive numbers and a negative sign \
before all negative numbers.

.SH BUGS
No known bugs. But need to test if it works properly if initial string is \
seperated (eg _printf("Hello" "there %d", a, b);).
.SH KNOWN ISSUES
None. It's perfect.
