.SH NAME
_printf \- print with formatting and conversions.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B #include <holberton.h>

.BI "int _printf(const char *" "format" ", ...);"
.SH DESCRIPTION
_printf is a function that accepts a formatting string with any number of \
format specifiers (beginning with a '%') which are replaced with the proceeding\
 arguments. Format specifiers must match the data types of arguments passed to \
them with the exception of conversion specifiers.

.SH OPTIONS
_printf requires a string, which can contain any format or conversion \
specifiers. Subsequent arguments can be anything at all as long as \
datatypes match, and they will replace your format specifiers.

FORMAT SPECIFIERS:

%s - if no l modifier, will print string up to but not including '\0'.

%c - If no l modifier, int converted to unsigned char and resulting char \
is printed.

%d/i - prints integers. All ints passed are converted to type unsigned long.

%% - prints a literal '%'.

%b - number is converted to binary

%x/X - converts number to unsigned  hex format. X will print uppercase letters\
, while x will print lowercase.

%o - converts number to unsigned octal format.

%# - alternate forms. This flag will prefix certain formats with an indicator.\
 0x and 0X before hex, 0 before octals.

'-' - left justify your text.

'+' - adds a positive sign before all positive numbers and a negative sign \
before all negative numbers.

%S - print a string but non-printable characters are printed in hex ascii \
value, preceeded by '/x'.

 - (space) a blank will be placed before all positive numbers (or empty string) \
produced by a signed conversion.

h/l - length modifiers for d, i, o, u, x, and X.

0 - width is padded with zeros.

%r - prints string in reverse

%R - prints ROT13 of string

.SH SEE ALSO
printf(3)
.SH BUGS
Will occasionally print a random % when trying to print a %.

Will segfault sometimes if passed more than 7 arguments, but not every time.

Might give your computer bedbugs. Use at your own risk.

.SH KNOWN ISSUES
None. It's perfect. Also failing ~100 checks, +/- 50 or so. NBD.

On the other hand, it doesn't handle floats and I would like it to do more \
cool things like convert format string into MD5. Also would like to add \
ability to choose padding character.
